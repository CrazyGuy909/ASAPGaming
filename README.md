"I recently revisited the old ASAP setup, fixed many bugs, and got it to a better state, though I ran out of steam before finishing everything.

Gonzo's instructions were helpful but could be clearer, so here’s a quick guide:

Requirements: A server, a VPS - install nginx and mysql-server
Setup:
Install package-lock in your marketplace folder.
Edit addresses to link everything to the server.
Modify the following components: Arena, inventory, battlepass, gobblegums store, and gangs. Each has its own SQL addresses to update.
Known Issues:
The loader crashes after 12-14 hours; restart every 12 hours to prevent it.
Gangs functionality is basic—saves members and money but little else.
What’s Included: A working setup for Arena, Gobblegums, VPS, Inventory, F4, Gangs, Store, Crafting, and Battlepass.
Extras: Printers are from Nebula (not original) but work with donation skins if needed.

I failed to download the original marketplace files so thats the reason that isn't here.

You should only need to adjust addresses; everything else should work without major bugs.

Two more things,

You probably will need to manually create A LOT of tables for battlepass, gobblegums and stuff to work but if you have basic sql knowledge should take a couple minutes each
